This project is an introduction to C programming. One had to demonstrate that they understand the C concepts: “comments”, “Data types | Integer types”, “Declaration”, “Characters”, “Arithmetic operators”, “Variables assignments”, “Comparisons”, “Logical operators”, “if, if…else”, “while loops”.
The topics covered in the project tasks include:
 
	* What is main in a C program
	* How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
	* How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
	* How to compile using gcc
	* What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
	* What are the boolean operators and how to use them
	* How to use the if, if ... else statements
	* How to use comments
	* How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
	* How to assign values to variables
	* How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
	* How to use the while loop
	* What is the ASCII character set
	* What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64 

Requirements for the project were:

	1 * C
	2 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	3 * All files to be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	4 * All files should end with a new line
	5 * A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
	6 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
	7 * There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
	8 * The code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
