In this folder, we implement functions that test on concepts in pointers to pointers and how to use them, multidimensional arrays and how to use them and common C standard library functions to manipulate strings.
The functions covered include:

1. 0-memset.c : Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

	. Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
	. The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
	. Returns a pointer to the memory area s
