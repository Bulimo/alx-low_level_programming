In this folder, we implement functions that test on pointers, arrays and strings C concepts coupled with
scope of variables.
At the end of the tasks, one should be able to use pointers and arrays, know the differences between pointers and arrays and use strings and manipulate them.
The functions covered include:

1. 0-reset_to_98.c : Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

	. Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);
