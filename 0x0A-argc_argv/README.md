The main objective of this project task is to help one gain an understanding 
of arguments passed to your program and how to use them, the different prototypes of main 
and in which case do you use one or the other and how to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

The code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

Not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` provided should be included in the header file called main.h

You are allowed to use the standard library

The functions in the projects include:

	1. 0-whatsmyname.c : a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.
	2. 1-args.c : a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
	3. 2-args.c : a program that prints all arguments it receives.
	4. 3-mul.c :  a program that multiplies two numbers.The program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line.You can assume that the twn numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer,If the program does not receive two arguments,your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
	5. 4-add.c : a program that adds positive numbers. Prints the result, followed by a new line; If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line; If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1. Assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int 
	6. 100-change.c : a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.
