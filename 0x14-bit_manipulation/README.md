# 0x14-bit_manipulation

## Objectives

	. How to manipulate bits and use the bitwise operators

## Requirements

	. Editors: vi, vim, emacs
	. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	. Betty style compliant code. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	. No global variables
	. No more than 5 functions per file
	. The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
	. You are allowed to use `_putchar`
	. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
	. All your header files should be include guarded
