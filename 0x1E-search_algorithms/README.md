# 0x1E-search_algorithms

## Objectives

    . What is a search algorithm
    . What is a linear search
    . What is a binary search
    . What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements

	. Editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
	. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    . A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
	. `Betty` style compliant code. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
	. No global variables
	. No more than 5 functions per file
    . Allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, â€¦ is forbidden.
	. All header files should be include guarded
    . The prototypes of all functions should be included in file called search_algos.h
